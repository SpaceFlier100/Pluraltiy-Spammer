On line 29 change the email prefix to anything you want. NOTE: you cant choose and email that already has a Plurality account so make it something abstract or just random characters.
On line 42 is the response text. By default, it is set to yourmum, but you can change it to anything.
When you stop the bot look at the last print line, it will give you the number of times it spammed as well as what email number it got up to. Swap the value for botint (which starts on 0) to that value, so it won't use the same email twice.
